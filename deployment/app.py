    In an E-commerce business, retaining existing customers is as crucial as attracting new ones, since customers are key revenue sources who purchase products through the platform.
    When customers stop using the service‚Äîa phenomenon known as churning‚Äîthe company loses potential income. While churn is common in business, companies can work to minimize it by identifying
    customers at risk of churning and offering them targeted incentives or special treatment to encourage continued engagement and loyalty.

    In this app, I've conducted an exploratory data analysis on an Ecommerce customer churn dataset to uncover insights on what features indicates that a customer will churn. Not only that, I trained
    a machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm to predict the likeliness of a customer to churn. Feel free to check them out from the navigation pane on the left side of the page.
                
    The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be acessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction/discussion?sort=hotness).
